                <h1>Hardness, Bulk & Sheer Moduli Predictor</h1>
                    <p>By using machine learning models, we can predict the bulk modulus, sheer modulus,<br> and mechanical hardness of a compound, given only its chemical formula as input. <br> The models were trained with data from the Materials Project database, including over <br> 10,500 target compounds and 121 features based on stoichiometric attributes, <br>elemental properties, and electron orbital occupations.</p>
